# Duckworth-Lewis-Stern Implementation and Analysis

This repository implements and analyzes the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) Method along with its predecessors, Duckworth-Lewis Standard (DL-STD) and Duckworth-Lewis Professional (DL-PRO). The DLS Method is an advanced algorithm used in cricket to calculate revised targets for interrupted matches, incorporating modern scoring trends and other key parameters.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Raw cricket ball-by-ball data from 2000â€“2023 is processed to generate relevant features like overs remaining, wickets lost, and runs remaining.
   - A curated dataset is used for both One Day Internationals (ODIs) and T20 Internationals (T20Is).

2. **Mathematical Models**:
   - **DL Standard (DL-STD)**: Uses a simple exponential decay formula based on overs remaining and wickets lost.
   - **DL Professional (DL-PRO)**: Enhances DL-STD by introducing a match factor (\(\lambda\)) for high-scoring games.
   - **Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS)**: Further adapts DL-PRO by introducing overs and match factor-dependent adjustments.

3. **Win Prediction Model**:
   - A logistic regression model predicts the win probability during the second innings based on overs remaining, wickets in hand, and run rates.

4. **Web Application**:
   - The project includes a Streamlit-based web app for real-time target and par-score predictions.

## Features

1. **Model Implementation**:
   - Implements DL-STD, DL-PRO, and DLS methods using Python.
   - Incorporates non-linear regression to fit model parameters.

2. **Inference for Match Interruptions**:
   - Predicts revised targets using real-world scenarios for both ODIs and T20Is.
   - Supports predictions using DL-STD, DL-PRO, and DLS methods.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Generates graphs comparing predicted vs. actual data to validate the models.

4. **Web App**:
   - Interactive interface for real-time score and win probability prediction.

## Examples

### ODI Scenario
```python
team1_score = 350
team2_wicktes_down = 2
team2_overs_completed = 10
lost_overs_due_to_rain = 5

print(inference_ODI(Z_dls_params, Z_std_params, team1_score, team2_wicktes_down, team2_overs_completed, lost_overs_due_to_rain, method='DLS'))
```

### T20I Scenario
```python
team1_score = 139
team2_wicktes_down = 2
team2_overs_completed = 6.5
lost_overs_due_to_rain = 13.1

print(inference_T20I(Z_dls_params, Z_std_params, team1_score, team2_wicktes_down, team2_overs_completed, lost_overs_due_to_rain, method='DLS'))
```

## Limitations and Future Work

- **T20 Matches**: The method for T20 matches is adapted from ODI logic. More research is needed for T20-specific scenarios.
- **Isoprobability Criterion**: The current DLS method does not consider this, which can be an area for future improvement.
- **Win Probability**: The logistic regression model can be improved by incorporating probabilistic analysis for better predictions.
